##goCD outline##

1. Explain why goCD is resourceful

	a. Model complex workflows - can configure dependencies - features allow you to run networks of processes in parallel and in a predictable way.

	b. See how your workflow really works - goCD tracks changes from a commit, good to use if something goes wrong.

	c. You can deploy any version at any time

2. Explain downfalls

	a. slow when given something large-scale

3. Use virtual-based environment

	a. Need Virtualbox and Vagrant

	b. Setup- open command prompt, in empty directory. Type vagrant init gocd/gocd-demo. This makes a vagrant file. Then type vagrant up.

	c. Another good example of setup given at "https://www.google.com/search?q=goCD+demo&rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS545US545&oq=goCD+demo&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0j69i60.1888j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8"

4. We will then run demos

	a. Programs for consideration:

	i. Things already used in class so that we are sure of results

	ii. Something new?

5. Film demo using camtasia or screencast-o-matic.
